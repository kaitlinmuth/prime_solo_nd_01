##Scope of Work

####Overview
The purpose of this project is to remotely host a responsive digital resume for Kaitlin Muth.

####Content
Content will be organized into contact information, a summary statement, previous experience, and education. Contact information will be divided into header and footer navigation. Single-paragraph summary statement will lead the page, followed by an experience section divided into three columns, then education section divided into three columns. Experience will be limited to six positions. Education will be limited to three institutions. Client-provided creative assets will accompany summary statement and each experience or education subsection.

####Design
The site will be designed using developer-dictated color palette and fonts. Responsive design will be build on Bootstrap framework, per client request, with a standard desktop and small screen/mobile views. Font Awesome glyphicons will be used to enhance Contact Information section. 

####User Experience
Users will not be able to directly interact with the page except to click on links in Contact Information sections.

####Delivery
Per client request, content will be hosted using free online service Heroku and backed up using free online service GitHub. These tools are outside the control of the developer, and use of these tools may result in unforeseen disruptions of service.
